<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Joshua Lee Petersen. I am a high school senior, expecting to graduate this May! I am taking the 2024 Web <br>
  Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu to try and learn more about web development and to learn some general coding skills. <br>
  I want to have a career in either cybersecurity or finance, so I figured taking this course would get me a head start on CS.</p>
